# DOOM Classic

- UIKit changes (UIAlertView, UISlider)
- AudioSession isn't available
- Newer C++ compiler

# Storage limitations

- app is limited to 200 MB
- 500 KB of persistent storage (`NSUserDefaults`)
- Use iCloud
- Use On-Demand resources

---

# No direct manipulation

# Focus engine

```swift
UIButton().canBecomeFocused() // == true or false
UIButton().focused // == true or false
UIScreen.mainScreen().focusedView // nil or the view in focus
```

---

# Reacting to focus changes

```swift
func didUpdateFocusInContext(context: UIFocusUpdateContext,
	withAnimationCoordinator coordinator: UIFocusAnimationCoordinator)

context.nextFocusedView // the view which gets the focus
context.previouslyFocusedView // the view which had the focus

func addCoordinatedAnimations(_ animations: (() -> Void)?,
                   completion completion: (() -> Void)?)
```

# Game Controllers

![100%](images/tumblr_mjv57cS2LJ1s5jjtzo1_500.gif)

![inline](images/game-controllers.png)

```swift
NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserverForName(GCControllerDidConnectNotification,
		object: nil, queue: nil) { (note) in
	if let controller = note.object as? GCController {
    	if let microPad = controller.microGamepad {
        	microPad.dpad.valueChangedHandler = { (_, x, y) in
        		if let paddle = self.childNodeWithName("Paddle") {
        			paddle.position.y += CGFloat(y)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

# Game Controllers work with UIKit components

![inline](images/input-destination.png)

---

# Siri remote is also a game controller

- Profile `GCMicroGamepad`
- Touch surface is a dpad
- Two action buttons
- Motion (`GCMotion`)
- Seems not to work in the simulator

---

> 2.27 If your app‚Äôs core functionality doesn‚Äôt work with the Siri remote it will be rejected. The app may, however, provide enhanced functionality in connection with a game controller or other peripheral

---

> A maximum of two game controllers (plus one remote) can be connected to an Apple TV at any given time.

# Conclusion

- tvOS works very well
- If you know UIKit, it's easy to start
- Think about interaction
